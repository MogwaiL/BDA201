The average on a statistics test was 78 with a standard deviation of 8. If the test scores are normally distributed,

find the probability that a student receives a test score less than 90.  
(93%)  
find the probability that a student receives a test score greater than 85  
(40%)  
find the probability that a student receives a test score between 60 and 80  
(79%)  
find the score k, such that there would be 93% probability for a randomly chosen score to be above k  
(K = 66.2)

```{r}
less90 <- pnorm(90, mean = 78, sd = 8)
less90

great80 <- 1 - pnorm(80, mean = 78, sd = 8)
great80

twixt68 <- 0.8 - pnorm(60, mean = 78, sd = 8)
twixt68

kmeans93above <- qnorm(.07, mean = 78, sd = 8)
kmeans93above
```
